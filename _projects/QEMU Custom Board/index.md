<!-- # Header 1 
Used for the title (already generated automatically at the top)
## Header 2  
Use this for the header of each section
### Header 3 
Use this to have subsection if needed


## Embedding images 
### External images
{% include image-gallery.html images="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52821641477_d397e56bc4_k.jpg, https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/52822650673_f074b20d90_k.jpg" height="400"%}
<span style="font-size: 10px">"Starship Test Flight Mission" from https://www.flickr.com/photos/spacex/52821641477/</span>  
You can put in multiple entries. All images will be at a fixed height in the same row. With smaller window, they will switch to columns.  

### Embeed images
{% include image-gallery.html images="project2.jpg" height="400" %} 
place the images in project folder/images then update the file path.   


## Embedding youtube video
The second video has the autoplay on. copy and paste the 11-digit id found in the url link. <br>
*Example* : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v={**MhVw-MHGv4s**}&ab_channel=engineerguy
{% include youtube-video.html id="MhVw-MHGv4s" autoplay= "false"%}
{% include youtube-video.html id="XGC31lmdS6s" autoplay = "true" %}

you can also set up custom size by specifying the width (the aspect ratio has been set to 16/9). The default size is 560 pixels x 315 pixels.  

The width of the video below. Regardless of initial width, all the videos is responsive and will fit within the smaller screen.
{% include youtube-video.html id="tGCdLEQzde0" autoplay = "false" width= "900px" %}

## Adding a hozontal line
---

## Starting a new line
leave two spaces "  " at the end or enter <br>

## Adding bold text
this is how you input **bold text**

## Adding italic text
Italicized text is the *cat's meow*.

## Adding ordered list
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
4. Fourth item

## Adding unordered list
- First item
- Second item
- Third item
- Fourth item

## Adding code block
```ruby
def hello_world
  puts "Hello, World!"
end
```

```python
def start()
  print("time to start!")
```

```javascript
let x = 1;
if (x === 1) {
  let x = 2;
  console.log(x);
}
console.log(x);

```

## Adding external links

## Adding block quote
> A blockquote would look great if you need to highlight something


## Adding table 

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1, Col 1 | Row 1, Col 2 |
| Row 2, Col 1 | Row 2, Col 2 |

make sure to leave aline betwen the table and the header

The goal of this project is to create a simulation environment for the NXP S32K3X8EVB board using
QEMU. This environment will allow developers to test and develop embedded software applications
without the need for physical hardware, thereby reducing costs and increasing accessibility. The
specific objectives of the project include:

- Setting up QEMU to emulate the NXP S32K3X8EVB board.
- Configuring necessary peripherals and interfaces, such as UART and SPI, to ensure accurate simulation of the board’s functionality.
- Porting FreeRTOS to the simulated environment to enable real-time operating system capabilities.
- Testing the simulation environment with sample applications to validate the implementation.
- Documenting the implementation process, challenges encountered, and solutions devised to overcome them.

In particular the peripherals that will be implemented are:
• UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter)
• SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface)
